### Tech
- [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth) is the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go. By installing and running geth, you can take part in the ethereum frontier live network and
    - mine real ether
    - transfer funds between addresses
    - create contracts and send transactions
    - explore block history


- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) Chrome Plugin

    MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser today. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

    MetaMask includes a secure identity vault, providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.

    We’re initially building MetaMask as a Chrome plugin, but eventually plan to support Firefox and beyond. If you’re a developer, you can start developing with MetaMask today.

    Our mission is to make Ethereum as easy to use for as many people as possible.
